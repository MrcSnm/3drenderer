# 3D Software Renderer

This repo is meant to be a study in C of how a 3D Software renderer works.
It is not meant to be ultra blazingly fast (at least yet).
It represents a basic on how to:

- Render lines, triangles and meshes;
- Apply backface culling;
- Apply flat shading;
- Texturing with texture coordinates
- Z buffer ordering
